#Global: depth, afuncs, lfunc, lrate, regval, regfunc
#Hidden: width,      afunc, pers_lrate, w_init, b_init
#Output: width,      afunc, pers_lrate, w_init, b_init
#Hyperparameters before tab have no defaults, while those
#after do. Only difference between hidden and output
#is that ReLU is default afunc in he former and softmax is
#default afunc in the latter. The other defaults are:
#pers_lrate = global lrate, w_init is rand in [-1,1] and
#b_init is rand in [0,1].
